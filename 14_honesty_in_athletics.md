Whatever may be said of the
athletics of M. A. (k, this one thing,
at least, is true. Lvery student-who
represents this college on any athletic
team is a bona fide undergraduate
student of the institution, and has
come here unsolicited from an
athletic standpoint, and is here for
the puropsc of securing an education
and not for the purpose of engaging
in athletics.
Several years ago this college went
on record as condemning any and
all kinds of dishonesty, deception or
indirection in athletic matters, and
since that time we have offered no
inducement, either directly or in
directly, to any man to come here
for athletic purposes.
We are not alwavs successful in
winning games with the teams w r e
put out from the college, hut when
our hoys walk off the field at the end
of a game, whether they be victori
ous or defeated, we have the satis
faction of knowing that every stu
dent of the college, every patron and
every alumnus can point to that
hunch of boys and say; Every
solitaiy one of those fellows is a
clean, straight, simon pure, under
graduate student of M. A. (k, and
proud of the fact that there is not
a linger on his team.
The faculty and students of this
institution long since reached the
conclusion that there was more
decency, more morality and more
honor—indeed there was more satis
faction and pleasure—in losing an
athletic contest with a straight team
of college boys than in winning a

    
game with an aggregation of
athletes, many of whom were gather
ed from the four corners of the
earth simply because they were good
football or baseball players, and were
run into the college and given fake
courses or imaginary industrial posi
tions.
The faculty and students of the
college in their attitude toward
athletics are not trying to advertise
themselves as being possessed of a
heavenly virtue, transcending the
morality of their fellows; but they
simply claim to be decently honest —
and this much the State of*Mary
land has a right to expect of any one
of her collegiate institutions, whether
in athletics or in any other depart
ment of college work.
Among college men there are well
defined piinciples of honesty in
athletics. If the faculty and stu
dents subscribe to the well-known
rules governing amateur athletics,
which rules preclude the playing on
any team of a professional, a ringer,
or a student taking a fake course,
and at the same time permit a pro
fessional or a ringer to play on their
team, or frame-up a fake course to
hold some athlete who refuses to pur
sue the regular college curriculum,
then that faculty and those students
are dishonest, and all the explana
tions and excuses that they can offer
can not justify the act or bring it
within the purview of that general
honor which should characterize a
college man.
As students of M. A. (A we should
have a perfect right to doubt the gen
eral honesty of a faculty that we
knew were claiming to enforce the
rules governing amateur athletics,
and at the same time were permit
ting the students to engage in viola
tions of such rules.
If our faculty should do this, it is
natural that we would lose confidence
in them as gentlemen of integrity,
and we would have no right to expect
a square deal from them in recita
tions, in examinations, or in any
matters upon which a student’s suc
cess or happiness depends.
When men are really honest, they
can not be honest in some things and
dishonest in others; and we believe
the day is fast approaching when the
father who consigns his son to the
care and protection of a college
faculty will consider himself im
posed upon and outraged when that
same faculty is found inculcating
dishonesty into the mind of his son
by encouraging him in secret dickers
and deceptions in athletic matters, or
by shutting their eyes to tho-e acts
which they and the students both
know are not fair and square and
honest in connection with the prac
tice of their athletic affairs.
In conclusion, we present this
conundrum for the consideration of
(olleges: What is the difference,
morally considered, between the stu
dents of a college using underhand,
secret and dishonest methods in
securing success in athletics , and stu
dents cheating in recitation or crib
bing in examinations to secure suc
cess in scholarship?
