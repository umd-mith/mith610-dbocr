[TEXT UNREADABLE]: read (?) with great pleasure the history of of Maryland politics,
being published weekly in the Baltimore “Sunday Sun.”
These articles are from the pen of Mr. Frank R. Kent, secrefary and treasurer of this college.
Mr. Kent is not only an able and attractive writer, but the historical data presented in the articles gives
evidence of remarkable study and research. 

Every citizen of Maryland, and especially young men about to assume the  responsibilities of citizenship, would do well to read this history of the politics of our State.

It has been said that the true value of history, as it applies to nations, is to instruct a man how to
become a good citizen of his own country. Then certainly we should study the political history of our own State, and receive those impressions and make those deductions which will lead to the proper
conception of our civic duty as sons of the grand old commonwealth of Maryland.
