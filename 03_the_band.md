THE BAND

    
The Band, under the direction of
Principal Musician Donaldson, has
been doing great work. Early in
the autumn they reorganized and
began rehearsing at once. Quite a
number of new students entered the
band and became familiar with their
instruments in a very short time.
On several evenings the battalion
has been entertained by well-rendered
selections from the band.
