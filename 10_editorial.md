With this, the first issue of the
Triangle, we extend greetings to the
friends of M. A. C.: May you live
long and prosper! And this is ex-
actly the sentiment we trust you will
have for our college paper which
brings this greeting to you.
For a long time the necessity for a
student publication has been keenly
felt, and a few months ago the
Alumni of this college took the
initial step toward founding a
Journal of their own in order that
they might keep fresh old associa-
tion and be in constant touch with
college affairs. As so . . . however,
as the Alumni knew . . . a college

with
the "first issue of the Triangle—and
here we purpose staying just as long
as the students, Alumni and friends
of the college give us their encour
agement, cooperation and support.
The appropriateness of the name
Triangle is readily apparent when
we consider the triple suggestion
that on the base of Science rest
Agriculture and Engineering.
01 It will be our purpose to make the
Triangle one of the best college
publications in this or any other
State. A pait of the paper willbe
them to understand that this
£s "'dl as ours.
Another Triangle
will be the publication of neu~
and matters of general interest in
all the different special departments
of the college, including the Experi
ment Station, and editors have been
assigned to look alter the interest
of these departments.
In fact, the Triangle has been
organized on a broad basis, devoted
to no particular interest, but repre

    
senting the interests of all. The
policy of the paper will be such as
to appeal to the faculty, the students,
the Alumni, the fathers and mothers
in their homes, the scientist in his
laboratory, the fanner in his field
and the engineer in his workshop.
AVe simply request all who are in
terested in this college to subscribe
for the Triangle, pay the small sub
scription fee in advance, and we will
attend to the rest. We will keep you
posted cm all college news, will show
to the parents Just what their sons
are doing here, and will furnish to
the Alumni the gratifying evidence
that old M. A. (A is moving on in the
front rank of educational institu
tions and that something worth while
is being accomplished here.
For the present scholastic year the
Triangle will be published semi
monthly, on the first and middle of
each month, but if future success
justifies the change it may later on
he converted into a weekly publica
tion.
