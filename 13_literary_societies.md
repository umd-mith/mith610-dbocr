LITERARY SOCIETIES

    
Literary societies, where regular
old-fashioned, red-hot debates can be
held, and fiery declamations can be
delivered, represent a most important
adjunct to the regular college work.
The first meeting of both the
Morrill and New Mercer Literary
Societies for the new year will be
held on January 7, and the Triangle
could engage in no more important
work than in urging the members of
these societies to attend the meetings
regularly, to do their full duty as
members, to take an active interest
in all the proceedings and thereby
make this year the most successful
in the whole history of our literary
society work.
Many an able orator and forcible
debater got his start in such societies
as these.
