ATHLETICS

    
FOOTBALL TEAM OF â€™09
While our football team during
the past season did not achieve the
success they desired, or that we
naturally wished for them, we seem
to have had, in light of present facts,
a much better team than we had
imagined.
Many of our men being new at
the game, we lost several games we
should have won early in the season,
and owing to a chain of unfortunate
circumstances the team seemed,
later on, not to have struck that
winning gait which we had predicted
for them; but when we consider the
fact that Hopkins beat us 9 to 0 and
defeated St. Johns 18 to O,and this
together with the fact that St. Johns
is supposed to have had the best that
has gone out from that [text unreadable]

seem that [text unreadable]
strength of [text unreadable]
had a better [text unreadable] con-
sided at the time.
We greatly regret that the scarlet
fever scare at the college prevented
our annual game with St. Johns, for
notwithstanding the superiority of
St. Johns' record over our own, we be-
lieve that our boys would have given
a splendid account of themselves in
the game, and would have furnished
to our friends from Annapolis a
larger proposition than they had
bargained for.
Let us say, right here that St.
Johns had one of the best football
teams in this part of the country,
and we could have secured no

ball championship of Maryland in
'05 and '06, and we believe that we
will soon strike our winning stride
again and occupy the proud position
of those years.
TRACK TEAM
It probably takes longer to develop
a good track man than it does to
produce a good man in any other de-
partment of athletic sports.
